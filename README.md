#  Zentry Website Clone Landing Page
![Gaming Website Preview](Capture2.PNG)

This project is a **fully responsive front-end clone** of the official [Zentry website](https://zentry.com), built to replicate its clean layout, modern design, and professional aesthetic using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

It was created as a learning project to improve my front-end development skills and practice real-world UI replication.
